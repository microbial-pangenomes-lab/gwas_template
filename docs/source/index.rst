Welcome to microGWAS's documentation!
===================================

**microGWAS** is a snakemake-powered pipeline to carry out
an end-to-end microbial GWAS analysis.
Starting from annotated assemblies and a phenotype file, microGWAS
will run a number of single-locus and whole genome associations
using ``pyseer``, and annotate the associations results, as well
as generating a number of functional enrichment tests.
